<h1>About Me</h1>
<h3> Welcome to Dee's Page</h3>
<hr />
<p>
 Dee is a web development student at Udemy University. I picked up web development to add a new set of skills as a professional development challenge in 2024.

<p>I am a Braves fan. <br />
In my free time, I enjoy hiking, going to the movies and dancing, even though I'm mostly out of sync (lol).<br /> 
</p>

<p>I'm hoping that this new skill  help me in some ways affirm my belief that when I put myself to good utility, I can reach for the stars.

  Wishing you too the very bet in your endevours!!!
